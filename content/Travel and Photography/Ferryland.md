Ferryland, NL is about an hour drive from the capital city St. John. This was the second time I was there. This time, as we heard there was a giant ice-berg that had come to the shore. It was a windy day, nothing unusual about NL, as we drove, we saw a crowd of people and a bunch of cars parked on a street ending at the sea. Everything ends to the sea on an island. Everything is an ocean view.
NL is special.
We had a good look at the iceberg from that street and from other piece of land that stretched into the ocean. A sort of peninsula, which always makes for a beautiful walk or a drive as you have ocean on both of your sides.
Ferryland has a beautiful lighthouse which we saw the first time I was there, but this time the whole area was closed due to some movie shooting. Which people waiting there could not know for sure was official or someone just hired a person in reflective jacket to stop people from coming there.
Regardless, since the purpose of visit was to see the iceberg, we decided to not go for the hike.
