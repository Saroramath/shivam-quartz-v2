title: About Me
---

Hi! I am Shivam Arora. I am an independent researcher in AI safety and governance. I am a member at [Trajectory Labs](https://www.trajectorylabs.org), Toronto.

I am deeply interested in and dedicated to understanding how AI works. I see that as a pathway to design safer AI and to convincingly demonstrate when we should stop pushing the development of AI.

I currently live in Toronto, Canada and I love dancing, biking, yoga, hiking, and reading.
